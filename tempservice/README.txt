This is a basic temperature sensor example and based on the default sample from
Bluegiga. The difference with this one is that it take the temperature data and stuffs
it into the advertising data so that other devices can get the data without having
to connect to the device.

In this example the ASCII text that is used for the display is placed in the advertising
data so it is easy to read. A better example might be to use the float value instead.
